      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ariel, learning web development and living life in sunny/rainy (depending on the time of year) South Florida.

        This is my personal website, made with Nuxt.js as a way to learn the framework. Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/fullmetalbrackets/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this site's source code</a>. Eventually this site will have a portfolio of projects I've worked on, but for now feel free to read my blog -- really just a dump of documentation I've made for myself as I've learned web development, Linux, the command line, etc.</p>
